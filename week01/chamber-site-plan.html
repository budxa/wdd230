            <h3>Site Name</h3>
            <p>
                The reason to why I chose this name is that I am familiar with the
                location with a good understanding of it as I used to live in that
                neighborhood. Also, I have fond memories of this neighborhood of when
                I was a kid. In addition, there is a decent business community in this
                area.
